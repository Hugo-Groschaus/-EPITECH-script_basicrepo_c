# script_basicrepo_c

Welcome to my first script and public repository of Github

This script is mostly useful for Epitech student, very practical to create a basic repository in C ready to use.

How to use it

1/
First you will have to put the ".repos" folder in your home folder.
If you want to change the folder or the names don't forget to update your changes in the scrit

2/
Then you'll have to implement your own C lib in the lib/my folders => don't forget to modify your Makefile & my.h files at the same time !

3/
Finaly you'll just have to put the "genrepo_c" in your /bin/
-> sudo cp genrepo_c /bin/

That's it ready to use !
